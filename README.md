# Forecasting Voter Turnout

## Denison University â€“ Spring 2025

### Research Overview
This research project aims to analyze and forecast voter turnout by leveraging computational techniques in AI/ML, Natural Language Processing (NLP), entropy modeling, and data visualization. The study seeks to uncover patterns in voter behavior, political ideology, and geographical voting trends to provide insights into electoral dynamics.

### Project Categories

#### 1. Predicting Politician Ideology Using AI/ML and NLP
- Scraping and analyzing politicians' websites and speeches.
- Developing a model to assign ideology scores on a left-right political spectrum.
- Validation using DW-NOMINATE scores as ground truth.

#### 2. Modeling Entropy in Voter Turnout
- Quantifying uncertainty and unpredictability in party politicians.
- Applying entropy-based measures to analyze shifts in voter behavior.

#### 3. Data Visualization
- Creating interactive dashboards to represent ideological distributions.
- Visualizing voting patterns and turnout rates over time.

#### 4. Geographical Graphs
- Mapping voter turnout across districts and states.
- Identifying correlations between geographic factors and turnout rates.
- Utilizing geospatial data to enhance predictive models.
